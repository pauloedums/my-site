# Paulo Marques | Front End Developer

I am a Front End Developer and Ux Designer, I like to imagine sites/apps that people enjoy using and looking at. I know this is a cliche, but when technology is used to approach and make humans more human, only then a perfect communication is able to really hit the world. If you’re interested in working together or just want to say hi, don’t hesitate, contact me.

Feel free to use this code if this interest you.
